Frame Bicycler is a lightweight utility for batch processing sequences of pictures. 
You may want to view your sequence as a movie before distributing it. You may want to pre-process frames before
animating. You also may want to render off low res (also called "offline") copies of your sequence for previewing or
uploading to internet web sites. This program attempts to address that need by integrating the wealth of open source
applications for working with media with the Ruby programming language.

This project was began by Lee Azzarello <lee@rockingtiger.com>. It was influenced by Taryn McLaughlin
<taryn@rockingtiger.com>. The name is a joke on the very expensive application that sounds similar. The homage is to
fcheck.
